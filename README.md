# retail-sales-forecasting-demo
A concise end-to-end demo of retail sales forecasting using Python and scikit-learn. Demonstrates time-based feature engineering, model comparison (Linear Regression, Neural Network), and iterative forecasting for future periods. Designed as a lightweight, interpretable template for real-world demand prediction tasks.


Data analysis
* Load raw csv sales data
* remove out linears
* fit the high peak month (retreat the correct month of the year) to do : find the peak month of the year 
* Fit linear & seasonal trends
* Potential remodel (space increase) of the store at xx month

ML model:
* A
* B
* Comparing Fitting data results: all data vs only after remodel of the store

Final conclusion:
* Predicted yearly increase rate (all vs after store remodel)
* Seasonal increase rate (by month) (all vs after store-remodel)
* Get plot of all 12-month in x-axis and diffefent year in y-axis. Compare results before and after store remodel
