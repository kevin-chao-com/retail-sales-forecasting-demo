# üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Forecasting Demo

## üìò Project Overview

A concise, end-to-end demonstration of **retail sales forecasting** using **Python**.  

This project illustrates a practical workflow for analyzing historical retail data, fitting **linear regression** and **seasonal decomposition** models, and generating interpretable forecasts for future periods (**2025‚Äì2026**).

It is designed as a lightweight, interpretable template for real-world **demand prediction** and **trend analysis** tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Load Raw Sales Data**
- Load the CSV file containing historical monthly sales.
- Review dataset structure and basic statistics.
- Visualize the raw sales trend over time.

### **Step 2 ‚Äì Data Pre-Processing**
- Remove months with zero or outlier sales values.  
- Define **September 2016** as the starting point of the series, assuming **December** represents the annual peak month.
- Identify a clear structural jump in sales around **February 2020**, likely corresponding to a **store remodel or space expansion**.

### **Step 3 ‚Äì Model Fitting**
- Fit both **linear** and **seasonal** functions on the full dataset.  
- Split the data into **pre-** and **post-break** segments to capture distinct growth patterns.

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Forecast Generation**
- Train forecasting models (linear regression and seasonal decomposition) using data from **2020-Feb to 2024-Dec**.  
- Generate **iterative multi-period forecasts** through **December 2026**.

### **Step 5 ‚Äì Statistical Sales Summary**
- Compute **monthly and yearly sales growth rates**.
- Estimate **predicted growth for 2025‚Äì2026**.
- Compare **historical vs. forecasted** December and annual sales.
- Summarize additional insights such as average monthly sales and sales volatility.

## üß† Insights and Conclusions

- Sales growth accelerated noticeably after **February 2020**, suggesting a possible **remodeling or capacity increase inferred from the data**.  
- Forecasts indicate continued moderate growth through **2026**, with strong **December seasonality** each year.  
- Post-2020 model results provide a more accurate view of future performance than models trained on the full pre-2020 dataset.  
- The approach can be generalized to other retail datasets w
